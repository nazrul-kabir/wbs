                    <p>Founded in 2015, it was the beginning of a long and rich history. Since its inception, Water Bond has built over 
                        hundred vessels, from steamboats to diesel-electric oilfield services vessels with advanced dynamic positioning systems and naval 
                        vessels with complex combat systems.</p>       
                    <p>Water Bond has built, converted, repaired and upgraded almost every form of vessel, rig and offshore platform including tankers, bulk carriers,
                        containerships, fishing vessels, ferries, naval vessels and jack-up and semi-submersible drilling and production platforms.</p>       
                    <p>With its strong engineering disciplines and fully integrated, self-sufficient fabrication facilities, Davieâ€™s versatility has enabled 
                        it to leverage the best practices and transferable skills acquired from two centuries of shipbuilding to provide products and services for
                        industries including natural resources, rail, hydro-electric and nuclear power, defence and more.</p>
